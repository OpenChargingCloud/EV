    /// Two different questions, and a vehicle has to keep them apart.
    /// The time it shows is its own system clock. Whether that clock is any
    /// good is a separate matter, answered by asking a server that knows - and
    /// **this vehicle does not set its clock from the answer**. It measures the
    /// difference and reports it.
    ///
    /// That is deliberate. Stepping the clock of a machine that is metering
    /// energy and writing signed records is not something a background task
    /// does by surprise; a jump backwards would put two readings out of order
    /// and there would be nothing in the record to say why. Measuring is the
    /// part that can be done safely and is the part that tells somebody whether
    /// there is a problem.
    ///
    /// **"Legal time" is never guessed.** Nothing here can tell from a hostname
    /// whether a server disseminates a country's legal time - that is a fact
    /// about an institution, not about DNS. So the operator says so, in
    /// <c>nts.legalTimeAuthority</c>, and this vehicle then only repeats that
    /// claim while it can stand behind it: the claim exists, the clock was
    /// actually checked against that server, the check is recent, and the
    /// difference it found was small. Any one of those missing and the display
    /// says the time is unverified instead - which is a true statement about a
    /// vehicle that has not checked, and the whole point of not printing the

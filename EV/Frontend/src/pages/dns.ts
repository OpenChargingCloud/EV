 * are exchanged in the client rather than in a copy of it. Nothing here waits
 * for a restart.
 *
 * Switching name resolution off takes the servers away from the client, which
 * is what off means: a query then fails at once instead of quietly going to
 * whatever the machine happens to have configured.
 *
 * A name server asked over TLS or HTTPS shows a certificate, and its row says
 * what the vehicle made of it and what it is held to; a dialog changes the
 * latter in the list on screen, which is saved with everything else.

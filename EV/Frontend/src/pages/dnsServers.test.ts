/**
 * How long the DNS page waits for the vehicle to look something up, and what

 *
 * Run with `npm test`. What is pinned is what was wrong: the page added the
 * servers' timeouts up, as if the vehicle asked them one after another, when
 * it asks all of them at once - and it is what a server asked again takes
 * that the page has to be willing to wait for, not what it takes once. And
 * that a name server goes back to the vehicle with what it is held to, where
 * it shows a certificate to hold it to, and with nothing the vehicle only said
 * about it.

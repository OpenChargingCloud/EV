/**
 * What the web interface does when the vehicle does not answer.

 * Run with `npm test`, which is Node's own runner reading the TypeScript as it
 * stands - no bundler, no browser, no dependency that is not already here.
 *
 * What is pinned is what was measured to be wrong: a page that waited 98
 * seconds after Save with both buttons greyed out and nothing to say, nine
 * requests left hanging by seven clicks, and a vehicle that could not be
 * reached described to the operator in the browser's words rather than in
 * words about a vehicle.
